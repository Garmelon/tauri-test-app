# Tauri test app

This is a repo for testing [tauri]. It is meant to include a tauri app that runs
both on desktop and Android, as well as a CLI and some shared Rust crates in a
workspace that are used by both. The app and CLI should be built by CI for Linux
and Windows, the Android app will need to be built manually.
